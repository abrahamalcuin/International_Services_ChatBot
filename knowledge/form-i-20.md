International Student Services New Students

After international students (transfer students included) have been conditionally admitted to BYU-Idaho, they can begin their application for Form I-20. The Form I-20 is a Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status issued to prospective international students who have been accepted into a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certified school. This form is issued by International Services at BYU-Idaho from a Designated School Official (DSO). You will use the I-20 to schedule a visa interview at your local U.S. Embassy. If you are conditionally admitted to BYU-Idaho, you will receive an invitation from International Services to apply for an I-20.
