International Student Services Graduating Students

International Services can transfer an active SEVIS record to a new school where they will issue you a new I-20. When we transfer your SEVIS record, you do not need to pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee again, and your new school will hold your record. If you are not graduating and are currently enrolled in classes, we must wait to transfer your record until the end of that semester. Before we can transfer your record, you will need to be admitted to a new school. You can submit an acceptance letter and request the transfer of your record by filling out the Transfer Out Request on Sunapsis. As soon as the transfer is complete, any BYU-Idaho work authorizations or campus activities that require you to be a student will be completed on the date your record is transferred regardless of the expiration date. This would include CPT and OPT authorizations.
