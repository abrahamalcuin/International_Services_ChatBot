International Student Services Current Students

The U.S. government takes working illegally very seriously. There are limited work opportunities available in the U.S. to international students. Because of this, international students are required to prove the financial ability to pay for tuition and living expenses while studying. International students can apply for any campus job, and it does not have to relate to their major. You can apply for jobs by looking through job postings on the Job Board. If you are an incoming student, you can begin working on campus up to 30 days before your first semester starts. We encourage you to work with your Career Advisors from each college as you navigate these employment opportunities. Employment limitations: You are not permitted to work off-campus unless you have received authorization from International Services for an internship (see next topic). You can only work up to 20 hours per week while required to be fully enrolled (you may work full-time during school breaks and your flex track if you are taking less than 12 credits).
